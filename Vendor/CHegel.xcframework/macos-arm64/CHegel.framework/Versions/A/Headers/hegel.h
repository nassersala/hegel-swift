/*
 * libhegel — C bindings for Hegel's native property-based testing engine.
 *
 * This header is generated from hegel-c/src/lib.rs by cbindgen. Do not
 * edit it directly; re-run `just c-header` after changing the Rust source.
 *
 * libhegel implements the core of property-based testing: generation,
 * shrinking, the example database, and the decision of what to run next. It
 * ships as a shared library (libhegel.so, libhegel.dylib, hegel.dll) with a
 * C ABI.
 *
 * Terminology
 * -----------
 * - Library: the language-specific frontend that calls into libhegel.
 *   Sometimes called the caller below, since from libhegel's point of view
 *   it is whatever is making the calls.
 * - Context: holds the diagnostic message of a failed call. Passed as the
 *   first argument to nearly every function.
 * - Run: the full lifecycle of one property test, including executing many
 *   test cases and shrinking any failures.
 * - Test case: a single execution of the test function and the concrete
 *   values generated for it. Cloning a handle yields more handles onto the
 *   same test case, each with its own choice sequence.
 * - Span: a labeled grouping of draws that tells the shrinker which draws
 *   belong to one unit.
 * - Reproduce blob: a base64 string encoding a test case's choice sequence,
 *   which can be replayed later to reproduce it exactly. It is only
 *   guaranteed to reproduce the failure in the version of Hegel in which it
 *   was generated.
 *
 * Calling convention
 * ------------------
 * Every function takes a hegel_context_t* as its first argument and returns
 * a hegel_result_t code, except for hegel_context_new, which returns a
 * context, and hegel_context_last_error, which returns the message pointer
 * directly.
 *
 * HEGEL_OK is zero and every error code is negative. Anything else a call
 * produces is written through a trailing out-parameter named out_*.
 *
 * Every function returns HEGEL_E_INVALID_HANDLE when passed a NULL handle
 * (except the *_free functions, where NULL is a no-op) and
 * HEGEL_E_INVALID_ARG when passed any other invalid argument (a NULL
 * out-parameter, inverted bounds, a non-UTF-8 string, and so on). The
 * functions below leave these implicit.
 *
 * A NULL context is always allowed and opts out of error messages. The call
 * still returns its usual error code. A context must not be used
 * concurrently from multiple threads, since each fallible call overwrites
 * the stored message.
 *
 * Ownership
 * ---------
 * Pointers you pass into a libhegel function are always owned by the
 * caller. libhegel reads them during the call and copies whatever it needs
 * to keep, so you may free or reuse the memory as soon as the call returns.
 * Run results own their data and are independent of the run they came from.
 *
 * Release every pointer returned by these functions with its matching free:
 *
 *     hegel_context_new          ->  hegel_context_free
 *     hegel_settings_new         ->  hegel_settings_free
 *     hegel_run_start            ->  hegel_run_free
 *     hegel_test_case_from_blob  ->  hegel_test_case_free
 *     hegel_next_test_case       ->  hegel_test_case_free
 *     hegel_test_case_clone      ->  hegel_test_case_free
 *     hegel_run_result           ->  hegel_run_result_free
 *     hegel_run_result_failure   ->  hegel_failure_free
 *     hegel_string_generator_*   ->  hegel_string_generator_free
 *     hegel_new_collection       ->  hegel_collection_free
 *     hegel_new_pool             ->  hegel_pool_free
 *     hegel_new_state_machine    ->  hegel_state_machine_free
 *     hegel_generate_bytes       ->  hegel_generate_bytes_result_free
 *     hegel_generate_string      ->  hegel_generate_string_result_free
 *
 * Every other pointer libhegel hands back is a borrowed string. The caller
 * must not free it, and it is valid only until a documented point.
 * hegel_context_last_error is invalidated by the next call on that context.
 *
 * Threading
 * ---------
 * Each kind of handle has its own threading contract:
 *
 * - A context must not be used concurrently from multiple threads. Each
 *   fallible call overwrites its stored message, so sharing one across
 *   threads is a data race.
 * - A settings handle may be shared across threads once configured, but
 *   each setter call requires exclusive access.
 * - A run handle must only be used from one thread at a time. Calling
 *   hegel_next_test_case, hegel_run_result, or hegel_run_free concurrently
 *   on the same run is undefined behavior.
 * - A test-case handle may be driven by at most one thread at a time.
 *   Concurrent operations on it return HEGEL_E_CONCURRENT_USE. To generate
 *   from several threads, hegel_test_case_clone the handle and give each
 *   thread its own clone.

 `callback` / `user_data`: Where this replay's output goes, with the
