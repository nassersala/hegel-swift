/*
 * libhegel — C bindings for Hegel's native property-based testing engine.
 *
 * This header is generated from hegel-c/src/lib.rs by cbindgen. Do not
 * edit it directly; re-run `just c-header` after changing the Rust source.
 *
 * libhegel implements the core of property-based testing: generation,
 * shrinking, the example database, and the decision of what to run next. It
 * ships as a shared library (libhegel.so, libhegel.dylib, hegel.dll) with a
 * C ABI.
 *
 * Terminology
 * -----------
 * - Library: the language-specific frontend that calls into libhegel.
 *   Sometimes called the caller below, since from libhegel's point of view
 *   it is whatever is making the calls.
 * - Context: holds the diagnostic message of a failed call. Passed as the
 *   first argument to nearly every function.
 * - Run: the full lifecycle of one property test, including executing many
 *   test cases and shrinking any failures.
 * - Test case: a single execution of the test function and the concrete
 *   values generated for it. Cloning a handle yields more handles onto the
 *   same test case, each with its own choice sequence.
 * - Span: a labeled grouping of draws that tells the shrinker which draws
 *   belong to one unit.
 * - Reproduce blob: a base64 string encoding a test case's choice sequence,
 *   which can be replayed later to reproduce it exactly. It is only
 *   guaranteed to reproduce the failure in the version of Hegel in which it
 *   was generated.
 *
 * Calling convention
 * ------------------
 * Every function takes a hegel_context_t* as its first argument and returns
 * a hegel_result_t code, except for hegel_context_new, which returns a
 * context, and hegel_context_last_error, which returns the message pointer
 * directly.
 *
 * HEGEL_OK is zero and every error code is negative. Anything else a call
 * produces is written through a trailing out-parameter named out_*.
 *
 * Every function returns HEGEL_E_INVALID_HANDLE when passed a NULL handle
 * (except the *_free functions, where NULL is a no-op) and
 * HEGEL_E_INVALID_ARG when passed any other invalid argument (a NULL
 * out-parameter, inverted bounds, a non-UTF-8 string, and so on). The
 * functions below leave these implicit.
 *
 * A NULL context is always allowed and opts out of error messages. The call
 * still returns its usual error code. A context must not be used
 * concurrently from multiple threads, since each fallible call overwrites
 * the stored message.
 *
 * Ownership
 * ---------
 * Pointers you pass into a libhegel function are always owned by the
 * caller. libhegel reads them during the call and copies whatever it needs
 * to keep, so you may free or reuse the memory as soon as the call returns.
 * Run results own their data and are independent of the run they came from.
 *
 * Release every pointer returned by these functions with its matching free:
 *
 *     hegel_context_new          ->  hegel_context_free
 *     hegel_settings_new         ->  hegel_settings_free
 *     hegel_run_start            ->  hegel_run_free
 *     hegel_test_case_from_blob  ->  hegel_test_case_free
 *     hegel_next_test_case       ->  hegel_test_case_free
 *     hegel_test_case_clone      ->  hegel_test_case_free
 *     hegel_run_result           ->  hegel_run_result_free
 *     hegel_run_result_failure   ->  hegel_failure_free
 *     hegel_string_generator_*   ->  hegel_string_generator_free
 *     hegel_new_collection       ->  hegel_collection_free
 *     hegel_new_pool             ->  hegel_pool_free
 *     hegel_new_state_machine    ->  hegel_state_machine_free
 *     hegel_generate_bytes       ->  hegel_generate_bytes_result_free
 *     hegel_generate_string      ->  hegel_generate_string_result_free
 *     hegel_printer_options_new  ->  hegel_printer_options_free
 *     hegel_printer_new          ->  hegel_printer_free
 *     hegel_printer_deferred     ->  hegel_printer_free
 *     hegel_test_case_printer    ->  hegel_printer_free
 *     hegel_printer_value        ->  hegel_printer_value_result_free
 *
 * Every other pointer libhegel hands back is a borrowed string. The caller
 * must not free it, and it is valid only until a documented point.
 * hegel_context_last_error is invalidated by the next call on that context.
 *
 * Threading
 * ---------
 * Each kind of handle has its own threading contract:
 *
 * - A context must not be used concurrently from multiple threads. Each
 *   fallible call overwrites its stored message, so sharing one across
 *   threads is a data race.
 * - A settings handle may be shared across threads once configured, but
 *   each setter call requires exclusive access.
 * - A run handle must only be used from one thread at a time. Calling
 *   hegel_next_test_case, hegel_run_result, or hegel_run_free concurrently
 *   on the same run is undefined behavior.
 * - A test-case handle may be driven by at most one thread at a time.
 *   Concurrent operations on it return HEGEL_E_CONCURRENT_USE. To generate
 *   from several threads, hegel_test_case_clone the handle and give each
 *   thread its own clone.

 A pretty-printer document.

 Built from three primitives: `hegel_printer_text` emits unbreakable text,
 `hegel_printer_breakable` marks a point that renders as a separator if the
 enclosing group fits on one line and as a newline plus indentation if it
 does not, and `hegel_printer_begin_group` / `hegel_printer_end_group`
 delimit the groups those decisions are made over. Breaking is
 all-or-nothing per group, decided outermost groups first. The engine only
 provides the layout machinery; what gets printed — and in which language's
 syntax — is entirely the client's choice.

 Two facilities support printing values *while generating them*:
 `hegel_printer_deferred` opens a hole whose content is written later
 (while the test body runs) and spliced in by `hegel_printer_resolve`, and
 `hegel_printer_begin_speculative` buffers output that a rejected draw
 (a filter retry, a failed assumption) can retract.

 Create a standalone document with `hegel_printer_new`, or fetch a handle
 onto a test-case handle's region of the family document with
 `hegel_test_case_printer`.

 # Ownership and concurrency

 A printer handle addresses one *region* of a document — the document
 body for a root handle, or a hole for a handle from
 `hegel_printer_deferred`. Handles follow the test-case handles' model: a
 handle may move between threads, but belongs to one thread at a time —
 concurrent operations on the *same* handle return
 `HEGEL_E_CONCURRENT_USE`. To print from several threads, give each
 thread its own region: `hegel_printer_deferred` opens a hole at the
 handle's current position, and content written into it from any thread,
 on any schedule, renders at that anchor point — so concurrent output is
 deterministic, and two handles never interleave within one region.

 Every handle — including those returned by `hegel_printer_deferred` —
 must be released with `hegel_printer_free`.

 Every option has a default, and a NULL options pointer means "all
 defaults", so callers that are happy with the defaults never construct
 one. New options are added as new setters, never by changing existing

 immediately afterwards.

/*
 Opaque handle to an engine-managed *recursive generation scope*: the
 leaf budget and retry bookkeeping for one draw of a recursively defined
 value (a tree, a document, ...).

 Created by `hegel_new_recursion` on a test case, once per recursive
 value drawn; driven by `hegel_recursion_branch` / `hegel_recursion_leaf`
 / `hegel_recursion_retry` / `hegel_recursion_finish` through any handle
 of the *same* test-case family (the root or any clone) — decisions are
 drawn from whichever handle makes the call. Like a pool, the scope holds
 an internal lock, so clone handles driven from parallel threads share
 the leaf budget safely.

 The protocol, for one sub-value (starting with the root at depth 0):
 call `hegel_recursion_branch`; on `true` invoke the user's branch
 function, drawing each of its sub-values at `depth + 1` with this same
 protocol; on `false` call `hegel_recursion_leaf` and then draw one leaf.
 When `hegel_recursion_leaf` returns `HEGEL_E_RETRY` the attempt has
 outgrown the leaf budget: unwind out of the user's generators without
 drawing anything further, call `hegel_recursion_retry`, and on `HEGEL_OK`
 start the whole value again from the root. Once the root sub-value has
 finished, call `hegel_recursion_finish`: `HEGEL_OK` accepts the value,
 while `HEGEL_E_RETRY` means the engine discarded the attempt as
 mispriced — drop the value and start again from the root (without
 calling `hegel_recursion_retry`). All policy — the branch probabilities
 and their adaptation to the branch arities actually produced, the depth
 and leaf limits, and when to give up — lives in the engine, so recursive
 values are identically distributed in every language frontend.

 Returns the most recent error message recorded on `ctx`, or the empty

 is NULL. The pointer borrows the context's internal buffer and is
 invalidated by the next call taking the same context.
 */
const char *hegel_context_last_error(const hegel_context_t *ctx);

/*
 Parameters:
 `out_settings`: Receives a handle initialized from the default settings
   profile.

 Returns `HEGEL_OK`, or `HEGEL_E_INVALID_ARG` when profile resolution
 fails: a default-profile setting names an unknown profile, or a
 `hegel.toml` is malformed. Read the message with
 `hegel_context_last_error`.

 A profile is a named settings delta. Two names are reserved: `base` is
 the immutable base settings (100 test cases, all phases enabled, normal
 verbosity, no seed, the disk database under `.hegel/`), and `default`
 is the default profile, the one in effect when nothing names a profile:
 the strongest set of `hegel_set_default_profile`, the
 `HEGEL_DEFAULT_PROFILE` environment variable, and the top-level
 `default = "<profile>"` entry in `hegel.toml`, else the detected
 environment (`workload` inside Antithesis, detected via
 `ANTITHESIS_OUTPUT_DIR`, or `ci` on a CI server, detected via `CI`,
 `GITHUB_ACTIONS`, and similar variables), else `development`. This
 function resolves `default`.

 Three ordinary profiles ship with libhegel: `development` (the base
 settings, unchanged — what local runs get), `ci` (derandomization on,
 database disabled, the `too_slow` health check suppressed), and
 `workload` (database disabled, every health check suppressed). A custom profile without an explicit `extends` extends
 `default`, skipping any candidate already in its chain, so it sits on
 `ci` when resolved on a CI server and on `development` locally. The
 shipped profiles themselves extend `base` and never layer over one
 another. Extending or selecting `base` pins the plain base settings.

 Profiles are modified and defined in a `hegel.toml` found in the current
 directory or the nearest ancestor, and registered programmatically with
 `hegel_settings_register_profile`; use `hegel_settings_new_for_profile`
 to resolve one by name.

 `name`: The profile to resolve: reserved (`base`, `default`), shipped

 Returns `HEGEL_OK`, or `HEGEL_E_INVALID_ARG` when the profile is unknown
 or a `hegel.toml` is malformed. Read the message with
 `hegel_context_last_error`.

 Selecting a profile by name does not change what the default profile is:
 the named profile still implicitly extends `default` (see
 `hegel_settings_new`), so it layers over the environment's profile —
 except `base`, which is always the plain base settings.

 collects — identified as `<class_name>::<function> passes properties` and
 located at `file:begin_line` — so the property is listed alongside the
 assertions in the system under test and flagged when it fails. Outside
 Antithesis the location is unused. Without a location nothing is
 reported. Like the database key, the location is per-test identity rather

 A library uses a reproduce blob to replay a counterexample: it reruns
 the minimal failing test case so it can display the drawn values and
 re-raise the test's own failure.

 There is no run handle and no run loop involved. The caller drives the
 returned test case with the usual per-test-case primitives, concludes it
 with `hegel_mark_complete`, and decides for itself whether the blob
 reproduced the failure (the property failed again) or is stale/flaky (it
 passed).

 Parameters:
 `blob`: A base64 blob from `hegel_failure_reproduction_blob`.
 `callback` / `user_data`: Where this replay's output goes, with the
   same contract as `hegel_run_start`. The callback is only ever invoked
   on this thread and need not outlive the call.
 `out_test_case`: Receives a caller-owned test-case handle. Released
   like any other with `hegel_test_case_free`.

 Returns `HEGEL_OK`, or `HEGEL_E_INVALID_ARG` for a blob that is not
 valid (corrupt, non-UTF-8, or from an incompatible Hegel version).

 A blob whose choices no longer match the caller's generators returns
 `HEGEL_E_STOP_TEST` from the draw that overruns.

/*
 Parameters:
 `indent`: How many columns further than `tc`'s own lines every line of
   the block is indented.
 `out_test_case`: Receives a new handle onto the *same* choice stream as
   `tc`.

 Returns `HEGEL_OK`, `HEGEL_E_INVALID_HANDLE` for a NULL `tc`, and
 `HEGEL_E_INVALID_ARG` for a NULL `out_test_case`.

 A block handle is how a client prints an indented section under a
 heading — the body of a stateful rule under its `Step 3: add {` line, the
 body of a repeated section — without touching every line itself. Its
 print region (see `hegel_test_case_printer`) is a block nested in `tc`'s
 region at the current position: everything printed or noted through the
 handle, and through the clones and blocks derived from it, lands there,
 each line indented `indent` columns further than `tc`'s lines (blocks
 nest, and their indentation adds up). The indentation is applied to a
 line when it gets its first content, so it covers the continuation lines
 of a value broken across lines too, and it ends exactly with the block:
 a line `tc` writes after the block's last one is back at `tc`'s
 indentation. It is independent of the break-point indentation
 `hegel_printer_begin_group` / `hegel_printer_shift_indent` manage.

 Unlike a clone, a block handle draws from `tc`'s own choice sequence:
 drawing through it and through `tc` are the same thing, so the two must
 not be driven concurrently (give a thread a clone instead). It shares
 everything else with `tc` — outcome, budgets, worker attribution as of
 its creation — and is released with `hegel_test_case_free` like any
 other handle. If `tc`'s region is dead (the document was read), the
 block shares the dead region and its prints are no-ops.

 Attribute this handle's output to concurrent worker `worker_index`:

 `[worker N +X.XXXms] `, where `X.XXX` is the time since the test case

 the handle after this call inherit the attribution (a worker's rule
 bodies and their clones print as that worker's), and may be attributed
 afresh on their own. Lines a group breaks across are stamped on their
 first line only.

 Register a *state machine* for engine-owned stateful (rule-based)
 testing, sequential or concurrent: `num_rules` rules — each assigned to
 a concurrency group by `rule_groups`, an array of group ids parallel to
 `rule_names`, and given a selection weight by `rule_weights`, an array
 of `num_rules` finite, strictly positive doubles parallel to
 `rule_names` (NULL for all-equal weights) — and `num_invariants`
 invariants, with names as
 NUL-terminated UTF-8, plus concurrency bounds. `invariant_always_check`
 is an array of `num_invariants` flags parallel to `invariant_names`
 (NULL for all-false): `hegel_state_machine_should_check_invariant`
 answers true unconditionally for a flagged invariant and samples the
 rest. Group ids are arbitrary
 (any value except `HEGEL_STATE_MACHINE_DONE`, which
 `hegel_state_machine_next_group` reserves as its termination sentinel):
 the machine has one concurrency group per distinct value of
 `rule_groups`. The engine draws the machine's concurrency
 level — the number of workers (typically worker threads) that will pull
 rules — in `[min_concurrency, max_concurrency]` and writes it into
 `*out_concurrency`; the caller must run exactly that many workers. The
 engine owns the distribution, which is weighted toward
 `max_concurrency` (concurrency bugs need concurrency) rather than
 shrink-biased toward the minimum. Pass `min_concurrency ==
 max_concurrency` to fix the level without consuming entropy — `1, 1`
 for a sequential machine. `step_count` is the target number of counted
 rounds the machine runs per test case: every case runs at least one
 round and at most `step_count` (at concurrency 1, where a round is one
 rule, that is at most `step_count` completed rules), and each sampled
 invariant is checked with probability `1 / step_count` per join point.
 The engine has no default; frontends typically use 50.

 The engine owns rule selection — including swarm testing, where each
 worker enables a random subset of rules (at least one per group) and
 selection draws only from that subset, with probability proportional
 to `rule_weights` among the enabled rules of the current group. A
 rule's realized frequency therefore depends on which other rules its
 worker has enabled: the weights are a guide, not a guarantee. The
 caller drives execution in
 rounds: on the root test-case handle it asks
 `hegel_state_machine_next_group` whether another round should run, then
 each worker asks `hegel_state_machine_next_rule` which rule to run and
 applies it, until that call signals the join point. Rules in
 the same group may run concurrently; rules in different groups never
 overlap.

 Creating the machine draws from the calling handle's stream: the
 concurrency level and each worker's swarm parameters are decided here,
 up front, so the machine is fully constructed before any rule is
 requested.

 Creating a machine with `max_concurrency > 1` declares the run
 nondeterministic: thread scheduling is outside the engine's control, so
 nothing that assumes deterministic replay can be trusted. On a run not
 already known to be nondeterministic, the first such creation is
 rejected with `HEGEL_E_ASSUME` — the caller should abandon the body and
 report the case `HEGEL_STATUS_INVALID`, exactly as for a failed
 assumption — and the engine flips the run at that case's end. Every
 later test case is marked nondeterministic before it starts (so a
 frontend can capture its whole trace for the failure report, including
 draws made before the machine is created) and its creations succeed.
 From the flip on, the run reports failures faithfully from the
 discovering execution and skips data-tree recording (and with it
 novel-prefix generation and the nondeterminism mismatch check), span
 mutation, the verify and shrink pass (and with it the flakiness check —
 generation stops at the first bug, so at most one failure is reported),
 targeting, and database persistence and reuse. Failures from such a run
 carry no reproduce blob. A notice explaining this is printed once, on
 the run's output, unless verbosity is quiet. This applies even to test
 cases whose drawn concurrency level is 1: the declared bound is what
 counts. Standalone test cases — `hegel_test_case_from_blob` replays —
 are never rejected.

 On success writes a caller-owned handle into `*out_state_machine` —
 pass it to subsequent `hegel_state_machine_next_group` /
 `hegel_state_machine_next_rule` / `hegel_state_machine_rule_rejected`
 calls (through any handle of the same test-case family) and release it
 with `hegel_state_machine_free` exactly once — writes the drawn
 concurrency level into `*out_concurrency`, and returns `HEGEL_OK`.
 Returns `HEGEL_E_ASSUME` for the run's first `max_concurrency > 1`
 creation (the caller should abort the body and call
 `hegel_mark_complete` with `HEGEL_STATUS_INVALID`; see above). Returns
 `HEGEL_E_STOP_TEST` when the engine's choice budget is
 exhausted (the caller should abort the body and call
 `hegel_mark_complete` with `HEGEL_STATUS_OVERRUN`). Returns
 `HEGEL_E_INVALID_ARG` if `num_rules` is zero, an entry of `rule_groups`
 is `HEGEL_STATE_MACHINE_DONE`, an entry of `rule_weights` is not finite
 and positive, `min_concurrency < 1`, `max_concurrency < min_concurrency`,
 `step_count < 1`, or on null / non-UTF-8 names.

 Start the machine's next round: make the per-round stop decision (a

 which concurrency group is current for the round. Writes the current
 group's id (its value in the creating `rule_groups`) into
 `*out_group_id` when a new round has begun and the workers should pull
 rules again — the id identifies the round's group, e.g. for trace
 output — or `HEGEL_STATE_MACHINE_DONE` (`INT64_MIN`) to indicate
 termination of the whole state machine. (`hegel_new_state_machine`

 unambiguous here.)

 hegel_new_state_machine) at every join point — after each worker's

 though there is only a single group.

 Draw the index of the next rule for worker `worker_index` to run this
 round, letting the engine choose the rule sequence. The returned index
 is always a rule belonging to the current concurrency group (see
 `hegel_state_machine_next_group`). Swarm testing is applied per worker:
 a random subset of rules is enabled (at least one per group) on the
 worker's first selection and selection is restricted to that subset for
 the rest of the test case.

 `tc` may be any handle of the machine's test-case family: the machine's
 state is family-wide, and the handle only determines which choice
 stream the selection draws land in. At concurrency 1, it's safe to use
 the root handle for everything. At concurrency > 1, each worker should
 draw from its own `hegel_test_case_clone` handle (a single handle may
 be driven by at most one thread at a time), cloned once before the
 first round and kept for the whole test case, while the root handle
 stays with whoever drives `hegel_state_machine_next_group`.

 `worker_index` identifies the calling worker and must satisfy
 `0 <= worker_index < concurrency` (the level drawn at state-machine
 creation and written to `*out_concurrency`);
 an index rather than the handle identifies the worker because a single
 OS thread could hold multiple test-case clones. Draws consult only
 per-worker and per-clone state, so draws on one worker don't affect
 draws on another.

 Writes `HEGEL_STATE_MACHINE_DONE` (`INT64_MIN`) into `*out_rule_index`

 for the next group / join point.

 concurrent printing deterministic: a clone's output appears at its

/*
 Append a note — `len` bytes of UTF-8 at `text` — to this test-case
 handle's print region (see `hegel_test_case_printer` for the region
 model). Each `\n`-separated line of the note becomes its own output
 line, so notes may contain newlines. Notes and drawn values from *one
 handle* appear in the order they were appended; a clone's notes appear
 in the clone's region.

 A note appended while a speculative region is open on the handle's
 region — the client is mid-way through printing a drawn value, and the
 note comes from inside that value's generation — is held back rather
 than spliced into the value's line, and appended once the outermost
 region closes, whether it is committed or aborted. Held notes are lost
 if the document is read first (the writer was a straggler).

 Notes never configure the document's width; they render at whatever
 width ends up configured (default 79).

 Returns `HEGEL_E_INVALID_HANDLE` for a NULL `tc` or a handle whose
 region is dead (the document was already read), and
 `HEGEL_E_INVALID_ARG` — with a diagnostic — for non-UTF-8 text or a NULL
 `text` with `len > 0`.

/*
 Parameters:
 `status`: A `hegel_status_t` value describing how the test case ended.
 `origin`: Identifies the origin of a failure. Used only when `status`
   is `HEGEL_STATUS_INTERESTING`; NULL otherwise.

 Returns `HEGEL_OK`, or `HEGEL_E_ALREADY_COMPLETE` if called twice on the
 same handle.

 Completion is first-caller-wins and applies to the whole test case: the
 first call from any handle records the outcome, and a later call on a
 different handle is a safe no-op. This function never returns
 `HEGEL_E_CONCURRENT_USE`: if another thread is mid-operation on the
 handle it waits, then completes.

 Choosing an origin string: libhegel groups failures by their `origin`. Two failures with identical
 origins are the same bug and get shrunk together. Each new origin is a
 new bug.

 A library must pass a stable value for the origin, such as the location
 of the failing assertion.
